          <h3>Beef Picadillo Enchiladas</h3>
          <p>
            These enchiladas — loaded with ground beef, tomatoes, Cheddar,
            olives and raisins — get a kick from Chinese five-spice powder.

          <h3>Good Eats Meatloaf</h3>
          <p>
            There's no mystery meat here! Alton Brown smashes together ground
            chuck and sirloin with spices and croutons, baking it with a
            spicy-sweet glaze.

          <h3>Quick Spicy Chili</h3>
          <p>
            Add a little beef and a little beer and a little chipotle, and
            you've got chili in no time.
